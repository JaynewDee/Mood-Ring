  >> What was your motivation? 
    >> Our motivation for creating Mood Ring was that we wanted to create a website that anyone could use no matter their age, location, etc. We wanted to create something that was useful and practical for all users.
  >> Why did you build this project?
    >> We wanted to challenge ourselves as a team to build something useful that wasn't strictly related to a traditional understanding of productivity. Our team has a vision of creating a space where a user could investigate further the causes and implications of their mood and usefully explore those findings.
  >> What problem does it solve?
    >> Mood Ring allows users to explore their deep emotions in a simple and easy way. Without even having to put a word to their feelings, using the psychology of colors, users are given unique visual & audio content that aids in self-exploration & self-help.
  >> What did you learn?
    >> While creating Mood Ring, we learned a lot about collaboration in GitHub and best practices when building a website with a small group. This project allowed us to all leverage our unique skill sets in new ways to create a cohesive website design.
